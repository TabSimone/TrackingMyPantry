# TrackingMyPantry
TrackinMyPantry is an app that allow users to keep track of the groceries they buy through their barcode and build up a collaborative database of barcodes that can be used by the community. This means that each developed app will make use of both a local database and a unique remote knowledge base that will be updated and queried.
